        <h2>Stigma and Mental Health
                           </h2>
        <p>
		<ul>
		<li> Many people don’t ask for 
             help because they feel 
              ashamed or scared they will 
                 be labelled as ‘crazy’, 
                    ‘weak’, ‘lazy’, or 
                     ‘inadequate’. </li>

         <li>                 Some people are afraid 
                friends or family might 
           judge them and treat them 
          negatively because they 
           sought the help of a mental 
             health professional.</li>
                </p>
        
        <h2>The reality is</h2>
        <p>
		<li>  We all need a little help sometimes and that is okay.</li>
        <li>  That doesn’t mean anything negative about us, it simply 
             means we are human.</li>
        <li>  Humans have emotions, concerns, thoughts, needs and 
             stresses. </li>
        <li>  Mental health professionals can help you balance these 
             important pieces of yourself.</li>
        <li>  1 in 5 Canadians will seek out help for their mental health in 
            their life time. Over 1900 UW students sought help from 
            Counselling Services in Fall term 2016. You are not alone.</li></p>
