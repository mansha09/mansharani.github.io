        <h2>What is Self-Care?
</h2>

		You might have heard the term 
self-care before but you might 
be unsure of what it means. 
Self-care activities are things 
you can do to help yourself 
achieve a better life balance. 
Achieving this balance can help 
you when times get stressful 
because your system is in a 
more optimal state before the 
high-stress time starts.
<br>
Self-Care Tip One: Regular Meals
<br>
Eating regularly helps fuel your 
body and brain to help you get 
through your day-to-day 
commitments and gives you 
focus. 
Try to get three nutritious meals 
a day and pack yourself healthy 
snacks when you aren’t at home
<br>
Self-Care Tip Two: Exercise
<br>
Giving your body a break from 
sitting while you are studying is 
important. Exercise has been 
linked to stress reduction in 
many studies. 
Try to stay connected with the 
activities you enjoyed before 
coming to university or take the 
opportunity to try something 
new! The Athletics department 
offers many different 
opportunities on campus for you 
to get active.

        <h2>What is Resiliency?
</h2>
        <p>According to the American 
Psychological Association, 
resilience is: “the process of 
adapting well in the face of 
adversity, trauma, tragedy, 
threats or significant sources 
of stress…It means ‘bouncing 
back’ from difficult experiences.” 
Building your resiliency skills can 
help you face life’s ups and 
downs more evenly, enabling you 
to be able to handle change and 
adversity when they come along.</p>
        
        <h2>Resiliency Tip One: Self-Esteem and Coping 
Thoughts</h2>
        <p>Remember your strengths and accomplishments when you are 
feeling down. You can pick big things, like getting into UW or a 
sports victory, or small, like holding the door open for 
someone. Think about a time that you went out of your way to 
help someone.
Use coping thoughts to remind yourself that an upsetting 
situation is temporary. If you are struggling to get along with a 
roommate, remind yourself that you’ll be moving out in four 
months. If you don’t enjoy the subject matter of a course, 
remind yourself that the class is only 12 weeks long and then 
you’ll have a new set of courses you might enjoy more.</p>
